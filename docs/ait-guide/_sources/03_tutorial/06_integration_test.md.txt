## Prepare for integration test
Prepare an AIT (as zip file) and input-data for integration test.

## Running integration test
The integration test is performed in the following procedure.
Refer to [Qunomon User's Guide](https://aistairc.github.io/qunomon/user-manual/index.html) for details on Qunomon installation and operation.

1. install AIT to Qunomon  
   Install the created AIT to Qunomon

The following operations are performed on Qunomon.

2. Create MLComponent  
   Create MLComponent.  
3. Create inventory  
   Create an inventory and register the input data for integration test.  
4. Define TestDescription  
   Define a TestDescription and register the installed AIT.  
5. Run TestDescription  
   Run TestDescription and confirm operation of the installed AIT.

## Evaluate integration test
See the details screen of TestDescription to check if the AIT is working properly.

If a problem occurs during integration test, clarify whether the cause is the AIT or Qunomon.
Check the logs below to identify the cause of the problem.

| No | Log Type  | Cause Pattern | Acquisition Method |
| --- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ait.log| AIT | [Download from the details screen of TestDescription](https://aistairc.github.io/qunomon/user-manual/03_Execution/03_Execution.html#testdescriptions-details-display) |
| 2 | Airflow log | AIT, Qunomon | [Acquisition method of airflow log](https://aistairc.github.io/qunomon/user-manual/03_Execution/03_Execution.html#run-testdescriptions) |

``` tip:: If a problem occurs during integration test, the cause may be an error in the usage of Qunomon or in the environment definition of AIT.
  Check the following points.

  * Incorrect inventory registration  
  * Incorrect TestDescription parameters  
  * AIT Dockerfile definition error (Omission of registration of required library)
  * Insufficient Docker definitions (memory, permission)  
```

## Modifying AIT
To register a modified AIT with Qunomon, remove the TestDescription and AIT and start over with `1. install AIT to Qunomon`.

``` tip:: To remove the registered AIT, remove all TestDescriptions that use the AIT.
