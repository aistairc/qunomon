# Preparation
After downloading and installing Qunomon, start developing an AIT based on the template.

## User workflow
![User Workflow](01/02_user_workflow.png)


## Fork the AIT template
AIT template : `https://github.com/aistairc/ait-template`.
![Alt template fork](01/03_ait_fork.png)

## Change AIT repository name
![Alt rename](01/04_ait_rename.png)

### Recommended naming convention of AIT
The recommended naming convention of AIT are as follows.
* `{prefix}_{target}_{task}_{format}_{measure}`

| name    | mandatory | description                                                                     |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| prefix  | Yes       | This represents the type of AIT. There are several reserved types.<br>- eval: Quality evaluation<br>- alyz: Analysis<br>- misc: Miscellaneous<br>- generate: Used for AIT that generates data to be input to AIT. |
| target  | Yes       | Choose either "dataset" or "model" depending on the   evaluation target of AIT. |
| task    | No        | The problem targeted by AIT.                                                    |
| format  | No        | The format of the data processed by AIT.                                        |
| measure | No        | The quality measured by AIT.                                                    |

* restriction
  * The name must be 50 characters or less.
  * The available characters are half-width alphanumeric characters and underscore `_`.

## Clone the AIT repository
Follow the URL to clone.
![Alt clone](01/05_ait_clone.png)

## Edit readme.md
After create a directory for new AIT, open `{YourAITName}/readme.md` and edit title.

* Before
  ```
  # ait-name
  ...
  ```
* After
  ```
  # {YourAITName}
  ```

## Launch development envionment
We are providing Jupyter Lab environment adjusted to the AIT development purpose as AIT development environment.
After launching them, they are provided as web application on the localhost. You can use them through your browser.

* Launcher
  * Windows:
    ```bat
    {Qunomon_root}/ait_repository/ait/{YourAITName}/tool/launch_devenv.bat
    ```
  * macOS, Linux:
    ```sh
    sudo bash {YourAITname}/tool/launch_devenv.sh
    ```

### Screenshots after launch
If the launch has succeeded, applications below are displayed automatically.

* Jupyter lab

### Development work flow

In this tutorial, we assumes following work flow as default development work flow.

1. Experiment and development of an AI evaluation program.
2. Porting AI evaluation program onto the AIT template.
3. Perform unit testing of an AI evaluation program.
4. Preparing registration for Qunomon.
5. Perform integration testing of an AIT with Qunomon testbed.
