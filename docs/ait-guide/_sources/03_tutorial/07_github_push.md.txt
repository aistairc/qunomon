# Publishing AIT
This chapter explains the steps to publish the AIT you developed.

``` important:: When you register your developed AIT on platforms like GITHUB or AIT-HUB, it becomes publicly available. Before publishing the AIT, ensure that no personal or confidential information is disclosed and that the publication aligns with your objectives. Please proceed with these precautions.
```
