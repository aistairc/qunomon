## Uninstall AIT

Clicking the "AIT Uninstall" button on the "Installed AIT List" screen will uninstall them.
(Note that if the AIT are related to any TestDescription cannot be uninstalled to ensure reproducibility and traceability. You can check "TD using status" column to judge whether the AIT is used in any of the TD or not.)

If the AIT is actually not required for any purposes, please delete all TestDescriptions related to AIT to be installed and then retry uninstall.
